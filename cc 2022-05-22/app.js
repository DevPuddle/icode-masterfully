// Now you have to write a function that takes an argument and returns the square of it.

//Take in something and return the square of it.
//PREP:
//P: Numbers will be taken into the function
//R: Return the value
//E: funtion demo(numVal){
//  return numVal**
//}
//P: 
//function syntax
// Write the "square"-function here
function square(num){
    //num will mul num
    //return said calculation
    return num * num
    //which will return the value to where it is called
}
